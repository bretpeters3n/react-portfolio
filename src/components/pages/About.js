        <p>
          I enjoy being at the forefront of technology and am focused on
          connecting everyday users with emerging technologies. I became
          interested in coding at an early age, and after practcing design in
          silicon valley for years, Iâ€™m excited to be doing it myself!
          <br />I really love street biking, live comedy, live music, and
          problem solving. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things :)

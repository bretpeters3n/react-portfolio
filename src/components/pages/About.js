      <p>
        I enjoy being at the forefront of technology and am focused on
        connecting everyday users with emerging technologies. I became
        interested in coding at an early age, and after practcing design in
        silicon valley for years, Iâ€™m excited to be doing it myself!
        <br />I really love street biking, live comedy, live music, and problem
        solving. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things :)

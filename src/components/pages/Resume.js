      <h5>Profile</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>My point of view, and a few thoughts on my profession:</strong>
        <br />I enjoy being at the forefront of technology and am focused on
        connecting everyday users with emerging technologies. I became
        interested in coding at an early age, and after practicing design in
        silicon valley for years, Iâ€™m excited to be doing it myself! I really
        love street biking, live comedy, live music, and problem solving. I
        enjoy meeting new people and learning new things :)

      <p>
        Throughout this 3+ month bootcamp we learned and practiced professional
        development on a wide array of projects.
        <br />
        The program was designed to teach us everything from client side HTML
        and CSS to server side Node.js.
        <br />
        Group projects were a big part of the experience and allowed us to
        practice working together to solve complex problems.
        <br />
        Listed below are my group project highlights:

            <strong>Cat Memory</strong>
            <br />
            This project consisted of 4 people total. I was designated as the
            leader for this project. My main work was done building the
            interactive Javascript portion of this project. I also assisted
            other team members with their code and questions.
